# 100-python-projects
I am trying to accomplish the mega project list from https://github.com/karan/Projects so a project a day or a week, depends. The projects are written in Python which I am trying to learn. I am just a novice so feel free to correct me or help me improve where ever I go wrong. You are free to use my code just don't use them as your homework assignment. 
To use these programs just install python on your system and run them as python <filename>
